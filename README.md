# Toolbox for processing and analysis of lithium-ion battery lab data in MathWorks MATLAB

This repository provides a one-stop-toolbox for easier lithium-ion battery lab data processing and analysis.

## Features
- Differential voltage analysis function
- More to come...

## Usage of the toolbox

We are very happy if you choose this toolbox for your projects and provide all updates under GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (29 June 2007). Please refer to the license file for any further questions about incorporating this battery model into your projects. We are looking forward to hear your feedback and kindly ask you to share bugfixes, improvements and updates on the parameterization or real-time implementation.

## Requirements

The functions were created with MATLAB 2020b. If you want to commit an updated version using another software release or a specific toolbox please give us a short heads-up. 

## How To Use

The main path contains several functions for different purposes. *DVA_method.m* functions allows for easier processing of low constant current charge/discharge sequences (Time, Current, Voltage) to enable differential voltage analysis (DVA) independent of the measurement device resolution.
